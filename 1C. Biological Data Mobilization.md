## FIGURE 1C VENN DIAGRAMS OF BIOLOGICAL DATA MOBILIZATION TO CENTRALIZED META-REPOSITORIES

Next we depict the completeness of ecological data mobilization towards centralized public meta-repositories.  
Venn diagrams of data mobilization to global online repositories were generated from all (or some) subclades for eight biodiversity groups (2 per realm in sensu lato): 
1. VERTEBRATES Seals and birds
2. INVERTEBRATES see breakdown in supplementary: free-living arthropods, free living non-arthropod invertebrates, and Parasites (arthropod and non-arthropod), 
3. HIGHER PLANTAE Vascular plants 
4. BRYOPHYTES Mosses, hornworts and liverworts
5. LICHEN Lichenized fungi 
6. FUNGI Free-living fungi
7. ALGAE Algae (green plus diatoms).
8. PROTISTS Heterotrophic SAR/Chromista.

No diagrams could be made for microorganism groups due to their large numbers and absence of consolidated lists of species. Thus, we restricted the analysis to the species of the eukaryotic checklist of Antarctic biodiversity
One representative data mobilization indicator was selected per shortfall (excluding Linnean as we use the realized inventories as reference). It must be noted that these indicators do not provide a general view of the status for each shortfall 
as they cover many elements, but rather provide an example of a widespread metric typically used in some elements of the shortfall dimension. These are:
1.	BIOGEOGRAPHICAL SPATIAL DATA. 'Wallacean' data mobilization was retrieved using the indicator “sps. with spatial records in GBIF repository”. 
2.	EVOLUTIONARY DATA. 'Darwinian' was evaluated with the indicator “sps. with genetic sequences in GenBank repository”.  
3.	TRAIT DATA. 'Raunkieran' was evaluated with the indicator “sps. with trait data in centralized repositories”. For the case of vertebrates it was Pantheria. For lichen and vascular it was TRY database. 
For bryophytes it was an extension of TRY named BryoForTraits (largely biased towards forest species, but the most complete compendium available). Fungi data was complemented from FungalTraits repository. 
For other groups we could not find centralized trait repositories and so were all scored to 0. 
4.	ABIOTIC TOLERANCE DATA. 'Hutchinsonian' was evaluated with the indicator “sps. with thermal tolerance limits in Globtherm compendium”. However, in this case we updated the compendium with additional entries of 
Antarctic species with thermal profiles from Antarctic research literature. 
5.	BIOTIC INTERACTION AND NETWORK DATA. 'Eltonian' was evaluated with the binary indicator “sps. with reported interactions listed in GLOBI repository).
All indicator information per species can be seen in the supporting dataset 1 in the corresponding columns of the same name as a binary character (1= presence, 0=absence).

The R code written for the calculations and visualization is the following:

#### 1. Read dataset with information by shortfall (0/1 indicators)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(data.table)

indicators <- fread('Inventory5IndicatorsF.csv', header=TRUE, sep=";")
head(indicators[,c(1, 15:19)])
indicators$SpeciesAccepted <- NULL
indicators$Phylum <- NULL
```

#### 2. Delete species with all 0's

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
indicators <- indicators[Darwinean ==1 | Wallacean ==1 |Eltonian ==1 |Raunkieran ==1 |Hutchinsonian ==1, ]
```

#### 3. Unify kingdom name

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kingdom <- unique(indicators$Kingdom.x)
kingdom # Join Amoebozoa + SAR/Protist

indicators <- indicators %>% 
  mutate(Kingdom.x = case_when(Kingdom.x == "SAR/Protist" ~ 'Protist',
                             Kingdom.x == "Amoebozoa" ~ 'Protist',
                             TRUE ~ Kingdom.x))
```

#### 4. Change to logic (0 = FALSE & 1 = TRUE)

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LogValues <- as.data.frame(apply(indicators[,14:18],2, as.logical))

LogValues <- cbind(indicators$Kingdom.x, LogValues)

colnames(LogValues)[1] <- 'Kingdom'

LogValues$Kingdom <- as.factor(LogValues$Kingdom)
```

#### 5. Create venn plot using ellipse

### *All kingdoms*

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(eulerr)

colors <- c("#56B4E9", "yellow", "orange", "blue", "grey") # "#009E73","orchid4"

plot(euler(LogValues[,2:6], shape = "ellipse"), 
     fills = colors, 
     legend = TRUE, 
     edges = FALSE,
     quantities = TRUE)
```
### *By kingdom*

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
kd <- unique(LogValues$Kingdom)
kd

for(i in kd){
df <- LogValues %>% filter(Kingdom == i)
  df <- df %>% dplyr::select(where(~ is.logical(.) && any(.)), where(negate(is.logical)))
  df <- df %>% relocate(Kingdom)
assign(paste0('df_', i), df)
print(plot(euler(df[,2:length(df)], shape = "ellipse"), 
         fills = colors, 
         legend = TRUE, 
         edges = FALSE,
         main=i,
         quantities = TRUE))
}

```
## *By functional group*
Here the coverage per functional group is displayed. To this end each species was assigned to a basic functional group characterization among each kingdom under the following groups: Animalia: macrofauna, soil invertebrates and parasitic invertebrates. Plantae/Algae: Embryophytes & Algae. SAR/Protist: Heterotrophic & Algae. Fungi: Lichenized & Non-lichenized fungi. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
func_indicators <- fread('Func_Inventory5Indicators.csv', header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(func_indicators[,c(1, 16:20)])
func_indicators$SpeciesAccepted <- NULL
func_indicators$Phylum.x <- NULL
func_indicators$Kingdom.x <- NULL



```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LogValues <- as.data.frame(apply(func_indicators[,13:17],2, as.logical))

LogValues <- cbind(func_indicators$Func_group, LogValues)

colnames(LogValues)[1] <- 'Func_group'

LogValues$Func_group <- as.factor(LogValues$Func_group)

kd <- unique(LogValues$Func_group)
kd

for(i in kd){
df <- LogValues %>% filter(Func_group == i)
  df <- df %>% dplyr::select(where(~ is.logical(.) && any(.)), where(negate(is.logical)))
  df <- df %>% relocate(Func_group)
assign(paste0('df_', i), df)
print(plot(euler(df[,2:length(df)], shape = "ellipse"), 
         fills = colors, 
         legend = TRUE, 
         edges = FALSE,
         main=i,
         quantities = TRUE))
}

```
Func_Group <- unique(func_indicators$Func_group)
Func_Group

```
